Earth view with Thomas Pesquet photographies from ISS
=====================================================

Thomas Pesquet, the french astronaut on ISS,
is taking many photographies of earth, especially cities.

This application references some of these photographies,
and superimposes them on a Earth view.

Just navigate on the Earth like Google Maps,
and switch between Earth view/Earthphotographies from ISS.

You will maybe see your city or your house from the ISS!
